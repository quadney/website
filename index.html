						<h3>About</h3>
						<div class="paragraph">
							<p>I'm ending my third year as a Digital Arts and Sciences major at the University of Florida. Digital Arts and Sciences is in the College of Computer Science and Engineering - this is a major in which design meets computer science, and art meets engineering.</p> 
							
							<p>After attending an Art Magnet school in Miami, <a href="http://dashschool.org/">Design and Architecture Senior High</a>, I grew tired of strictly art, and decided to pursue computer science. This is what attracted me to UF's Digital Arts and Sciences program, it integrates the challenge and problem solving of computer programming, with design and creativity.</p> 
							
							<p>I'm interested in Human-Computer Interaction, Program Management, Mobile Development, and Software Engineering in general - in addition, I love teaching others what I know and have learned. I have explored these areas through coursework in school, internships, and learning on my own time. When I have something in mind that I want to learn - I dedicate myself for weeks until I feel confident that I can teach someone else. This summer I have an internship with Amazon in the Transaction Risk Management Services - I'll be "integrating new research" with their current texhnology, in addition, I'll be learning cloud computing, data mining, and machine learning concepts. I'm incredibily excited to be living and working in the Seattle area for three months!</p>
							
							<p>I have a problem: <i>I want to learn everything.</i> Here is the summary of my attempts.</p>
							<p><i><a href="https://github.com/ssyyddnneeyy" target="_blank">Or go straight to GitHub</a></i></p>

								<h4>DAS Website</h4>
								<p>I get really passionate about things I care about. I was awarded most school spirited three years in a row at my high school, and I self-proclaimed to be the mascot while delivering monthly newletters (seriously though, <a style="color: #009eff" href="SchoolSpiritUpTheButt.jpg">look at my senior photo in the yearbook</a>.) Anyways, being in a big school such as UF, I found my niche in the Digital Arts and Sciences program, and my goal until graduation is to promote it and help people see what a great program it is. Bottom line: the website needed updating and no one else was doing it, so why not?</p>

								<h4>Airline Reservation Database</h4>
								<p>Final project for the course Information and Database Systems. We worked in teams of two to create a front-end and back-end for the database. In my team, I created the front-end interface including the PHP forms - with no prior PHP experience. We each created our own database prior to beginning the project, we used my partner's database. From this project and course, I learned a lot about MySQL, PHP, and Oracle databases, however, I've learned that I don't really care for writing or maintaining databases.</p>

								<h4>To-Do List Web App</h4>
								<p>After Yahoo took down the to-do list app Astrid, I decided to make my own because the current apps out there don't get the job done like Astrid did. After all the functionality is coded, I would like to connect this to a database, so users may create a real account, store reminders and multiple lists, connect to chrome app, and create extensions for chrome and gmail, just like Astrid. This was also inspired to help my boyfriend, who is very forgetful, and I wanted to create a list app that we could use to collaborate on little tasks that we can't forget to do during the week. </p>

								<h4>Papercuts</h4>
								<p>Papercuts is a video game created with three other students (team DigiSquid) in Spring 2013 for Theory and Production of Digital Arts and Sciences with Dave Small. Papercuts was created in the Unity 3D game engine. My role was as Aesthetic Lead - I made decisions and allocated tasks based on design of the 3D models, world layout, and textures. In addition, I also contributed to programming the first two levels, writing scripts and programming the physics engine to enhance gameplay. The first 7 weeks of the class were dedicated to writing the Design Doc, and the last 5 weeks were dedicated to producing the game. It was a challenging experience, but so far is the most fun and rewarding experience yet.</p>

								<h4>UF Library App</h4>
								<p>This was the product of my term project for Human Computer Interaction with Benjamin Lok. The assignment was to redesign an interface, and test whether the design was successful or not by implementing a user-study. My idea was to redesign the UF Library's interface that lets students know how many computers are available in a library. This is inefficient - sometimes students do not want to use a computer, and need to know if the library is busy or not before trekking there. Unfortunately, due to problem with accessing UF databases and recorded data, I could not get the right information I needed. I worked around this by asking users to subjectively rate how busy the library was if they were there.</p>

								<h4>The Fractal Machine</h4>
								<p>This was my final project for Introduction to Digital Arts and Sciences with Dave Small in Fall 2012. After creating a character in the program, you can explore different types of fractals with the character as the subject. Fractals include MCRM (multiple copy reducing machine), L-System, Mandelbrot and Julia Sets, and "create a scene" with plant-like fractals. This class was the second-most rewarding class to date - I learned invaluable knowledge to create programs written in Java, and a taste of modeling natural phenomenas in code.</p>

								<h4>Artwork</h4>
								<p>I went to an art magnet high school, Design and Architecture Senior High, where I studied graphic design, book arts, drawing, and painting. This is a collection of my favorite pieces, mostly from junior and senior year. I seldom make art now, for I am exploring ways to integrate art and computer science - essentially the reason why I am a Digital Arts and Sciences major.</p>
