								<h4>Java: The Board Game</h4>
								<p>This was a semester-long project for the class Object Oriented Programming that taught us [the hard way] how to design and write good OO code. The first two iterations, I was in a team of nine other students where we debated about how to design the system, wrote use-cases, design documents, implemented the design, and presented to the class what we had made. For the third iteration, we were split into different groups and had to start fresh. This class was literally like a full time job - super challenging to balance with the other classes I was taking, but also the most fun because of the inside jokes and friendships that were formed. Implementing these have really taught me the value of testing code (truly an inspiration to do Test Driven Development) and the value of writing reuseable code. It was also an inspiration to take Design Patterns in the Fall.</p>

								<h4>Lecture Loot</h4>
								<p>Lecture Loot was the term project for Intro to Software Engineering - our goal was to encourage students to attend classes more, buy enticing them to ear “money” to go to class. The idea was to bet on yourself to go to class, and if you did, then you wouldn’t lose any money - at the end of the week, you would get a certain percentage of money from the pool of people who didn’t go to each class that week.  I worked on the front-end of Android app initially, and then once that was set up, I worked on the front-end and backend logic for the iOS app. What was most fun about this project was learning how to write Android and iOS apps - they each have their quirks that are really interesting to deal with. </p>

								<h4>Note Art Generator</h4>
								<p>Use this program to take notes in class, and when you pause, the program will "get bored" and begin drawing doodles randomly around the paper. I was inspired to make this from my previous art experience; the lines in my artwork were brought to life from doodles, why not have the computer draw doodles for me? I’m excited to explore this more once school stops getting in the way…</p>

								<p>My friend <a href="http://www.peterfoti.com/">Peter</a> and I participated in the <a href="http://wiki.opendataday.org/GAINESVILLE2014">Hoggetown Hackathon</a> and made the “Beautify Gainesville” app. We didn’t follow the rules of the hackathon (to use a dataset that the city of Gainesville had collected over time) because we would rather make Gainesville a more beautiful place #yolo #poetic. Anyways, I developed the front-end of our iOS app (this was before I had much experience with Objective-C) (also was the inspiration to make the iOS Lecture Loot app).</p>

								<h4>DAS Website</h4>
								<p>I get really passionate about things I care about. I was awarded most school spirited three years in a row at my high school, and I was self-proclaimed mascot while delivering monthly newletters (seriously though, <a style="color: #009eff" href="SchoolSpiritUpTheButt.jpg">look at my senior photo in the yearbook</a>.) Anyways, being in a big school such as UF, I found my niche in the Digital Arts and Sciences program, and my goal until graduation is to promote it and help people see what a great program it is. Bottom line: the website needed updating and no one else was doing it, so why not?</p>

								<h4>Airline Reservation Database</h4>
								<p>Final project for the course Information and Database Systems. We worked in teams of two to create a front-end and back-end for the database. In my team, I created the front-end interface including the PHP forms - with no prior PHP experience. We each created our own database prior to beginning the project, we used my partner's database. From this project and course, I learned a lot about MySQL, PHP, and Oracle databases, however, I've learned that I don't really care for writing or maintaining databases.</p>

								<h4>To-Do List Web App</h4>
								<p>After Yahoo took down the to-do list app Astrid, I decided to make my own because the current apps out there don't get the job done like Astrid did. After all the functionality is coded, I would like to connect this to a database, so users may create a real account, store reminders and multiple lists, connect to chrome app, and create extensions for chrome and gmail, just like Astrid. This was also inspired to help my boyfriend, who is very forgetful, and I wanted to create a list app that we could use to collaborate on little tasks that we can't forget to do during the week. </p>

								<h4>Papercuts</h4>
								<p>Papercuts is a video game created with three other students (team DigiSquid) in Spring 2013 for Theory and Production of Digital Arts and Sciences with Dave Small. Papercuts was created in the Unity 3D game engine. My role was as Aesthetic Lead - I made decisions and allocated tasks based on design of the 3D models, world layout, and textures. In addition, I also contributed to programming the first two levels, writing scripts and programming the physics engine to enhance gameplay. The first 7 weeks of the class were dedicated to writing the Design Doc, and the last 5 weeks were dedicated to producing the game. It was a challenging experience, but so far is the most fun and rewarding experience yet.</p>

								<h4>UF Library App</h4>
								<p>This was the product of my term project for Human Computer Interaction with Benjamin Lok. The assignment was to redesign an interface, and test whether the design was successful or not by implementing a user-study. My idea was to redesign the UF Library's interface that lets students know how many computers are available in a library. This is inefficient - sometimes students do not want to use a computer, and need to know if the library is busy or not before trekking there. Unfortunately, due to problem with accessing UF databases and recorded data, I could not get the right information I needed. I worked around this by asking users to subjectively rate how busy the library was if they were there.</p>

								<h4>The Fractal Machine</h4>
								<p>This was my final project for Introduction to Digital Arts and Sciences with Dave Small in Fall 2012. After creating a character in the program, you can explore different types of fractals with the character as the subject. Fractals include MCRM (multiple copy reducing machine), L-System, Mandelbrot and Julia Sets, and "create a scene" with plant-like fractals. This class was the second-most rewarding class to date - I learned invaluable knowledge to create programs written in Java, and a taste of modeling natural phenomenas in code.</p>

This is a collection of my favorite pieces, mostly from junior and senior year. I seldom make art now, for I am exploring ways to integrate art and computer science - essentially the reason why I am a Digital Arts and Sciences major.</p>
